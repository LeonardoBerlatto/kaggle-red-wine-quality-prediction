# kaggle-red-wine-quality-prediction
This repository contains my solution to [Kaggle Red Wine Quality Prediction Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) solved using Python

## ðŸ¤” Insights

1. This problem can be modeled either as a **Regression** or **Classification** problem, I opted for modeling it as a Classification problem.

2. I also choosed to use all features instead of removing some of them, since they all kind of got a nice correlation between them.

3. I found it netter to compute *quality* into a binary variable (wine_quality) instead of trying to predicting the quality itself
